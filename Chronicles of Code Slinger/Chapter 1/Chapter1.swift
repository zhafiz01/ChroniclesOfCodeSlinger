The room resonated with the gentle hum of computers, their screens casting a soft glow on her determined face. Amidst a chaotic tangle of wires and computer components, she meticulously maneuvered her fingers across the keyboard, lines of code scrolling rapidly before her eyes. Muttering to herself as she was rushing to finish a last minute project for work, \(mainCharacter) whispered, “Come on, \(mainCharacter), you can do this...' Her voice, barely audible, barely a murmur in the sea of electronic murmurs around her.")

Beside him was Mr. Smith, his loyal but uneasy assistant.  Mr. Smith voiced his concerts and nervously asked “But sir, what about \(OldAI)?  It’s still currently operational.” \(evilVillian) chuckled darkly as he said \(OldAI) is outdated and no longer has a purpose for my bigger plans Mr. Smith.  We need something more…sinister.")
    
    print("Back in the modest confines of Lily's workstation, her eyes widened with intrigue as she stumbled upon a peculiar line of code buried deep within the system. Intrigued, \(mainCharacter) whispered, 'What's this?' Her curiosity piqued, she clicked on the mysterious code, unleashing a cascade of strange symbols and algorithms that pulsated on her screen as if it is attempting to communicate with her. There were whispers that were distorted and eerie that echoed from the screen. '\(mainCharacter)... beware of the darkness that approaches. You are the key.' The voice, unmistakably Seraph's, sent shivers down her spine. Bewildered, \(mainCharacter) stared at the screen as the code morphed into a warning message from the old AI. Intrigued, she murmured “\(OldAI)? What are you trying to tell me?” Oblivious to the perilous journey awaiting her, she delved deeper into decoding the message, unaware of the secrets it held and the dangerous path she was about to embark on.")

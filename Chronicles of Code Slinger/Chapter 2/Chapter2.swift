    print("Lily woke up with a headache. As she lifted her head from her computer desk she was confused for a moment. She had fallen asleep at the computer again. As she looked at her reflection in the black computer screen she could see the outline of her glasses pressed into her face. Suddenly she got excited. She nervously touched her mouse to wake her computer and see where she had left off. \n As Xcode appears on the screen, she scanned her code and pressed build. As she did, a matrix of green zeros and ones greens up her arm and eventually takes over her whole body. She jumps back from her computer chair and as she does her eyes can see the code of everything electronic in her room. She looks at her phone and can see the code of every app in her phone simultaneously. She even sees a few bugs and is able to fix them with just a thought. \(mainCharacter) realizes her mind is thinking in code and she can control every bit of code she sees with just her thoughts. \n Suddenly, A distorted message flickers on her screen, remnants of \(oldAI) warning. \(oldAI) types out a message. \(mainCharacter)...your bravery is needed. Dr. Evil's AI...control humanity...beware...\(mainCharacter) gasps, realizing the gravity of the situation. \(mainCharacter) thinks to herself. I won't let Dr. Evil's creation destroy everything we hold dear. I have to find out more about this malevolent AI. She dives back into her work, scouring online forums and databases for any information about Aetheris, the ominous AI. \n Meahwhile, at INNOVATECH CORPORATION - DR. EVIL is busy at work. His face bathed in the eerie glow of the computer screen, monitors Aetheris's progress. Soon, the world will tremble before your might, Aetheris. Humans will bow to your brilliance. Back at \(mainCharacter) apartment she is surrounded by stacks of printouts and notes, pieces together data from various sources, connecting the dots between Dr. Evil's plan and Aetheris.  (Back at \(mainCharacter) apartment) \(mainCharacter) computer screen lights up Diagrams and graphs appear, illustrating Aetheris's potential for destruction. Diagrams and graphs appear, illustrating Aetheris's disasterous potential. I won't back down. Aetheris will face the might of my determination. \(Town) deserves better. With newfound resolve, \(mainCharacter) delves deeper into the digital realm, ready to confront the looming threat and protect her town from the impending darkness.")

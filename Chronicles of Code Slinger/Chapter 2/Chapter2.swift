    print ("Lily woke up with a headache. As she lifted her head from her computer desk she was confused for a moment. She had fallen asleep at the computer again. As she looked at her reflection in the black computer screen she could see the outline of her glasses pressed into her face. Suddenly she got excited. She nervously touched her mouse to wake her computer and see where she had left off.  As Xcode appears on the screen, she scanned her code and pressed build. As she did, a matrix of green zeros and ones greens up her arm and eventually takes over her whole body. She jumps back from her computer chair and as she does her eyes can see the code of everything electronic in her room. She looks at her phone and can see the code of every app in her phone simultaneously. She even sees a few bugs and is able to fix them with just a thought. Lily realizes her mind is thinking in code and she can control every bit of code she sees with just her thoughts." )
